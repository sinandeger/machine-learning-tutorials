This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for tutorials related to astrophysics.

List of Examples
======

1. **CNN Example**: This notebook contains the convolutional neural network implemented to classify CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies into ellipsoid and disk morphology. The tutorial has been presented at the 235th and 237th meetings of the American Astronomical Society in hands-on machine learning workshops, details of which can be found [here.](https://sites.google.com/view/aas237mlworkshop)

2. **Random Forest Classifier Example**: This notebook addresses the same problem as in the CNN example, but using a random forest classifier working on morphological parameters extracted from the H-band HST images.
