This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for tutorials related to astrophysics.

List of Examples
======

1. **CNN Example**: This notebook contains the convolutional neural network implemented to classify CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies into ellipsoid and disk morphology. The tutorial has been presented at the 235th (2019, Honolulu, HI) and 237th (Online) meetings of the American Astronomical Society in hands-on machine learning workshops, details of which can be found [here.](https://sites.google.com/view/aas237mlworkshop)

2. **Random Forest Classifier Example**: This notebook addresses the same problem as in the CNN example, but using a random forest classifier working on morphological parameters extracted from the H-band HST images. Details within the notebooks and [here.](https://sites.google.com/view/aas237mlworkshop)

3. **Unsupervised Learning Example**: This notebook illustrates the application of an unsupervised learning technique on astronomical data. The technique employed here is t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE, Van der Maaten & Hinton 2008), and I use the same catalog of morphological parameters computed for the random forest classifier example.
